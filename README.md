Problem statement
Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Netflix is the most-subscribed video on demand streaming media service, with 260.28 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries as of January 2024.

It is crucial that they effectively cluster the shows that are hosted on their platform in order to enhance the user experience, thereby preventing subscriber churn.

We will be able to understand the shows that are similar to and different from one another by creating clusters, which may be leveraged to offer the consumers personalized show suggestions depending on their preferences.

The goal of this project is to classify/group the Netflix shows into certain clusters such that the shows within a cluster are similar to each other and the shows in different clusters are dissimilar to each other.
